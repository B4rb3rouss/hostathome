  # is attached to the case. That is, two names with the same spelling but
  # different case are to be treated as if identical. This means calomel.org is the

  # perform prefetching of close to expired message cache entries.  If a client
  # requests the dns lookup and the TTL of the cached hostname is going to
  # expire in less than 10% of its TTL, unbound will (1st) return the ip of the
  # host to the client and (2nd) pre-fetch the dns request from the remote dns
  # server. This method has been shown to increase the amount of cached hits by
  # local clients by 10% on average.

  # 0 (turned off). We think 10K is a good value.
